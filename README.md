# Property Management System

1. Property Manager Portal
2. Tenant Portal

### Property Manager Portal

- A system for property managers to keep track of their rental properties, tenants, upcoming payments, and approving/denying tenant maintenance requests.

### Tenant Portal

- A system for tenants to keep in touch with their landlords in a very convenient manner that is non-intrusive. They are able to see all of the property details and upcoming payments, as well as submit maintenance requests to the property manager that they see fit.
